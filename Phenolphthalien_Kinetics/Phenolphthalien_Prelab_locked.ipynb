    "The indicator **crystal violet (CV)** reacts with **NaOH (OH−)** according to:\n",

    "### Rate law\n",
    "The rate law for the reaction is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Rate = k₂ [CV][NaOH]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because [NaOH] is large compared to [CV] (≈ 1000×), therefore the reaction should be pseudo‑first order in CV:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Rate = k₁ [CV]$$, where $$k₁ = k₂ [NaOH]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this experiment **[NaOH] = 0.00800 M**. Changes in [CV] were monitored by measuring the absorbance (A) of the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to determine the order and rate constants\n",
    "1. Plot **Absorbance** vs **time**. If the plot is linear, the reaction is zero order in CV.  \n",
    "2. Plot **ln(Absorbance)** vs **time**. If the plot is linear, the reaction is first order in CV.  \n",
    "3. Plot **1/Absorbance** vs **time**. If the plot is linear, the reaction is second order in CV.  \n",
    "4. The slope of the linear fit equals **−k₁** (so **k₁ = −slope**).  \n",
    "5. Calculate **k₂** using **k₂ = k₁ / [NaOH]**.\n",
